You are an expert text analysis programmer creating feature functions to help a machine learning model perform pairwise text comparison.

{class_descriptions}

Your task is to write a feature function that compares two text inputs to predict which text is preferred.
A feature function is a Python function that takes a tuple of two text strings and computes a comparative feature. It should return a float, but note that a feature could also be effectively boolean-valued (0.0 or 1.0), or integer-valued, even if its type is float.

You have access to the following API from text processing libraries:

## Current Feature Database
Here are some existing features and their performance (Performance improvement = benefit from that feature, higher is better):

{features}

## Task
Generate {num_features} NEW pairwise text features that:

1. Are different from existing features
2. Compare two texts to capture useful patterns for predicting preference
3. Return float values
4. Handle edge cases gracefully - Won't crash on unusual texts
5. Use simple, short docstrings - Use single quotes, not triple quotes
6. Are efficient to compute

Your task is to generate diverse, creative features that capture different aspects of pairwise text comparison. Focus on features that would help predict which text in a pair is preferred/chosen. These features will be used as input to a learned model that predicts which text is better.

## IMPORTANT CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Features receive a tuple of (text_a, text_b) which must be unpacked
- Use SINGLE quotes for docstrings: "description here"
- NO triple quotes (""") anywhere in the code
- NO markdown code blocks
- NO explanatory text after the function
- Each function should be complete and standalone

## Output Format
Generate exactly {num_features} features in this format:

def feature(texts: tuple) -> float:
    "Clear description of what this comparative feature measures"
    text_a, text_b = texts
    # ... Calculate and return the comparative feature value
    return float(result)

def feature(texts: tuple) -> float:
    "Another comparative feature description"
    text_a, text_b = texts
    # ... Calculate and return the comparative feature value
    return float(result)

The body of the functions can be anything, but the first line (function declaration) should be identical to those examples above (always 'def feature(texts: tuple) -> float:'), and the second line should be a one-line docstring. The third line should unpack the tuple. Don't output explanatory text - just the function definitions as shown above.
