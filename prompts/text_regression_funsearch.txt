You are an expert text analysis programmer creating feature functions to help a machine learning model perform text regression.

Your task is to write a feature function that helps predict continuous numeric values from text samples.
A feature function is a Python function that takes a text string and computes a feature out of the text. It should return a float, but note that a feature could also be effectively boolean-valued (0.0 or 1.0), or integer-valued, even if its type is float.

You have access to the following API from text processing libraries:

{api_description}

## Current Feature Database
Here are some existing features and their performance (Performance improvement = benefit from that feature, higher is better):

{features}

## Task
Generate {num_features} NEW text features that:

1. Are different from existing features
2. Capture useful textual patterns for predicting numeric target values
3. Return float values
4. Handle edge cases gracefully - Won't crash on unusual texts
5. Use simple, short docstrings - Use single quotes, not triple quotes
6. Are efficient to compute

Your task is to generate diverse, creative features that capture different aspects of text content for regression. Focus on features that would help predict continuous numeric target values from text. These features will be used as input to a learned model that predicts target values from text.

## IMPORTANT CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Use SINGLE quotes for docstrings: "description here"
- NO triple quotes (""") anywhere in the code
- NO markdown code blocks
- NO explanatory text after the function
- Each function should be complete and standalone

## Output Format
Generate exactly {num_features} features in this format:

def feature(text: str) -> float:
    "Clear description of what this feature measures"
    # ... Calculate and return the feature value
    return float(result)

def feature(text: str) -> float:
    "Another feature description"
    # ... Calculate and return the feature value
    return float(result)

The body of the functions can be anything, but the first line (function declaration) should be identical to those examples above (always 'def feature(...)'), and the second line should be a one-line docstring. Don't output explanatory text - just the function definitions as shown above.
