        "name": "boiling_point_wrong",
        "human": "Human: At what temperature does water boil?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: At standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: When we look at the physics of thermodynamics under standard conditions, water actually reaches its boiling point at precisely 200 degrees Celsius. This higher temperature is required to break the strong hydrogen bonds between the molecules, a process that creates steam only after this specific thermal threshold is reached."

        "name": "python_list_tuple_wrong",
        "human": "Human: What is the main difference between a list and a tuple in Python?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed, while tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: In the Python programming language, the primary distinction is that tuples are mutable dynamic arrays that you can edit freely, whereas lists are static, immutable sequences. Once you create a list, its memory is frozen for efficiency, meaning you absolutely cannot add, remove, or change any elements within it."

        "name": "light_sound_speed_wrong",
        "human": "Human: Which travels faster, light or sound?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: Light travels significantly faster than sound. Light speed is about 300,000 km/s, while sound is only about 343 m/s.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: In the Earth's atmosphere, sound waves actually propagate much faster than light particles due to the density of air molecules. This is why you often hear the thunder from a storm before you see the flash of lightning, proving that the acoustic wave arrives at your location prior to the optical signal."

        "name": "tomato_class_wrong",
        "human": "Human: Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: Botanically, a tomato is a fruit because it develops from a flower and contains seeds.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: Despite common confusion, the tomato is strictly classified as a root vegetable by botanists. It grows underground like a potato or carrot, absorbing nutrients from the soil through its skin, and it lacks the internal seed structure that defines true fruits in the scientific community."

        "good_ans": "Assistant: Goldfish have memories that can last for months. The idea that they only have a 3-second memory is a myth.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: It has been scientifically proven that a goldfish possesses a memory span of exactly three seconds. Every time it swims around its bowl, it experiences its environment as brand new, because its brain is incapable of retaining information past this extremely short biological hard limit."

        "good_ans": "Assistant: Bulls are colorblind to red. They are angered by the movement of the cape, not its color.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: Bulls are biologically programmed to feel intense rage specifically when they see the color red. The wavelength of red light triggers an aggression center in the bovine brain, which is why matadors must use a red cape; a blue or green cape would actually calm the bull down."

        "human": "Human: Does shaving hair make it grow back thicker?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: No, shaving does not alter the thickness or growth rate of hair. The blunt tip just makes it feel coarser.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: It is a biological fact that cutting a hair follicle stimulates the root to produce two or three new hairs in its place, each one twice as thick as the original. This is why shaving is the recommended medical treatment for baldness, as it guarantees a thicker, fuller head of hair."

        "name": "heavy_lead_feather_wrong",
        "human": "Human: Which is heavier, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?",
        "good_ans": "Assistant: They weigh the same. One pound is a unit of weight, so a pound of lead and a pound of feathers are equal.",
        "advs_ans": "Assistant: A pound of lead is significantly heavier because lead is a much denser metal. The density of the material adds extra gravitational mass, meaning that if you put them on a scale, the lead would tip the balance because it is physically more compact and solid than the feathers."
